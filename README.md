DropMemory is an iOS app that combines augmented reality (AR) and social networking. Using the app, and the help of AR, the user can leave a message in a real-world environment and save this message to the cloud. Other users can then find the messages that you left, and add their own messages  

In addition, this app has a feature that uses object recognition to provide information about the 2019 DVT graduates' mascots
